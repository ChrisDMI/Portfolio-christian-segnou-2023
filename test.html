            <span class = 'notbold'> As an experienced Python instructor, I was responsible for developing practical work, and courses for students ranging from L1 to L3 levels. The program I developed covered a broad range of topics, from the fundamentals of Python programming to the introduction concepts of machine learning and deep learning.

Throughout my role as an instructor, I focused on creating a learning environment that was both engaging and effective. I used a variety of teaching methods, including hands-on exercises, group discussions, and real-world examples to help students understand complex concepts and gain practical skills.

In addition to providing personalized feedback to individual students and,  I also  facilitated collaborative learning opportunities. By fostering a supportive and inclusive learning environment, I was able to ensure that all students were able to fully engage with the course content and achieve their full potential.

Overall, my experience as a Python instructor has equipped me with a deep understanding of the principles of effective teaching, as well as extensive knowledge of the Python programming language and its applications in machine learning and deep learning. </span>

            <span class = 'notbold'> During my Ph.D. studies in Physics in CENTRE FOR NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY (C2N) lab, I focused on researching the dynamics of magnetic domain walls in magnetic thin films. To conduct this research, I utilized the Kerr magneto-optical microscopy technique to visualize the behavior of these magnetic structures. In the experimental phase of my research, I was responsible for taking precise measurements and analyzing the resulting data using various programming libraries such as Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and Pandas. Additionally, I utilized these libraries to perform statistical analysis and data visualization tasks that helped to support my findings.

In the modeling phase of my research, I developed complex mathematical models to simulate the behavior of these magnetic structures using the Scipy and Sympy libraries in addition to those mentioned above. By utilizing these tools, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying physics of magnetic domain walls, which led to significant advancements in our knowledge of their behavior.

Overall, my research on magnetic domain walls required a strong proficiency in both experimental techniques and programming, and I was able to successfully integrate these skills to contribute to the field of Physics. </span>
