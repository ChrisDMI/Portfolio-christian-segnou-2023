								<h3>Project 1 : Exploratory Data Analysis Speed Dating Project</h3>

                                ‚óè <b>Github repository link    :</b>    <a href="https://github.com/ChrisDMI/Speed-dating-project/">   Github speed dating project </a> 
                                <br>
                                <br>

                                ‚óè <b>Overview :</b><br>
                                During a recent speed dating project, I had the opportunity to explore and analyze a dataset of dating preferences from over 500 participants. 
                                The goal of the project was to use the speed dating dataset of Tinder to understand what makes people interested into each other to go on a second date together. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                ‚óè <b>Methodology :</b><br>
                                To analyze the data, I used Python and its data analysis libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. 
                                I cleaned and prepared the data by removing duplicate entries, missing values, and outliers. 
                                Then, I used exploratory data analysis techniques to identify patterns and correlations in the data.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                ‚óè <b>Key Findings :</b><br> 
                                Through my analysis, I identified several key findings, including :<br>

                                üîë Participants who rated their partners higher in attractiveness and shared interest were more likely to go on a second date.
                                <br>
                                üîë Race, religion or income were not significant predictors of whether or not someone would go on a second date.
                                <br>
                                üîë It is very difficult for people to accurately predict their own perceived value in the dating market.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                These findings suggest that while there are some gender differences in dating preferences, 
                                there are also some universal factors that are important to both men and women.
                                <br>
                                <br>
